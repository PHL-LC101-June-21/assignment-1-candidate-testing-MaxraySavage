# Candidate-Testing
I'm attempting to take this quiz project and generalize it to more easily administer arbitrary quizzes! The original only checks for a correct answer so we may not be able to do something like a personality quiz but we can do a little launchcode concept quiz perhaps! I can also add a little CTF/encryption component by using the answer key to encrypt a little congratulatory message.
